# Portfolio-Website

This portfolio website, crafted with Vue.js, Bootstrap-vue-next, and TypeScript on the frontend, and powered by NestJS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL on the backend, showcases a summary of my work. It details the process behind its creation, features a selection of my projects, and includes a contact form for easy communication.

## Still a work in progress!

This project still does not have a finished projects section as well as a not fully fleshed out about page.
